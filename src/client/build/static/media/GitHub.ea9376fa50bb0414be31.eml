Hello, dear user!

Someone has entered the correct password for your Github account a***=2E He=
re is the information that we have:

 *   Location: Saint Petersburg
 *   Application: Chrome 106=2E0=2E5249=2E103 (Linux)

If this wasn't you, please follow this link to our (https://github=2Ecom/se=
ttings/security<http://attacker=2Etk/>) for instructions on securing your a=
ccount=2E

Knowing the password isn't always enough to log into an account=2E In certa=
in cases, Yandex conducts an additional security check=2E If there aren't a=
ny suspicious logins in your account's login history, then you can be sure =
that whoever was trying to get into your account couldn't pass that extra c=
heck=2E In that case, your account is safe, but you still need to change th=
e password to one known only to you=2E

We care about the safety of your account=2EThanks, The GitHub Team
